clojure-intro-class
===================

## Introduction

A _pilot_ project to use Clojure for introductory Computer Science courses at the University of Minnesota, Morris. The main goal of the project is to provide beginner-friendly tools such as
more detailed & human-readable error messages and easy-to-use graphics library.

## Features

* error-related tools (GUI to show the errors)
* versions of core functions with pre-conditions
* string library for beginners

## Quick Start
:heavy_exclamation_mark: Make sure [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is installed.

Clone and run this repository to see the app in action.
```
git clone https://github.com/Clojure-Intro-Course/clojure-intro-class.git
cd clojure-intro-class
lein run
```

This runs the code in `src/intro/test.clj` file. Open your favorite editor
and write your own code in the file.

If you want to run your code in standard mode, write your code in 
`src/intro/test_standard.clj` file and run lein with `s` arg.
```
lein run s
```
